### Introduction

My name is **Andrew Valdez**. I'm a long-time programmer with experience coding everything from FPGA logic and advanced data structures to games and quick scripts for repetitive tasks. 

My intention with this portfolio site is to provide a quick and easy way to demonstrate some of my favorite projects I've worked on. 

### Background

I'm a graduate of the Anderson School of Management at the University of New Mexico. I received my **Bachelor of Business Administration**  in **Management Information Systems** in May, 2021 with a minor in Mathematics. I've been a programming for more than a decade now, beginning on my own in 2010 with a Python textbook, moving onto C++ in college, and more recently using JavaScript and Node.js for coursework. 
If I'm not working, chances are I'm focusing on a personal project, potentially this very site!
